# Support

## Forum

Support should happen as much as possible on [the forum](https://forum.mesg.com/c/support). This ultimately reduces the amount of support that we are doing because of the following reasons.

::: tip
Try as much as possible to redirect all support to the forum
:::

#### Searchable

Every question/answers can be found easily by the search engine.

#### Indexable

All topics on the forum are indexable and so just by searching on any Search Engine people could find the answer directly without even asking us.

#### Community involved

Persons on the forum can participate and answer another member's question when we are not available. They can also be promoted to official moderator.

#### Avoid duplication

The forum has a good system to detect similar questions when creating a new post. This reduces the amount of duplicated/similar questions

#### Resolved discussion

When an answer fixes the problem of the user, this answer is marked as "resolved" and other users can easily see what to do to resolve a similar issue.

## Chat

Support by chat can be done either on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/SaZ5HcE) or [Telegram](https://t.me/mesg_community). This support is not optimal as users cannot easily find the answer to their questions and so this pushes a lot of duplicated questions.

::: tip
When an question happen too many time on a chat, encourage people to create a new topic on the forum in ["support"](https://forum.mesg.com/c/support) or ["general"](https://forum.mesg.com/c/general).

The next time this question happen send the link from the forum as a response.

## Email

Direct email are really hard to track and can be lost in a huge amount of other emails. Try to avoid this as much as possible.

Of course a lot of people like to send an email and we need to give an easy way for them to have this type of communication. In this case solutions exists to have support platform that can aggregate all emails and even re-direct to the right person depending on the email.

Here is a list of such services that could be use.
- [https://www.intercom.com/](https://www.intercom.com/)
- [https://www.zendesk.com/](https://www.zendesk.com/)
- [https://www.helpdesk.com/](https://www.helpdesk.com/)
- [https://www.uservoice.com/](https://www.uservoice.com/)
- [https://hiverhq.com/](https://hiverhq.com/)

::: tip
If this is a common problem, and already answered in the forum, make sure to give a link to the forum when answering this email.

## Phone/Video call

This is really time consuming and should be avoided as much as possible.

Of course exception can happen for this **premium support** for special users or partners.

::: tip
Always try to push for a conversation by chat or email
