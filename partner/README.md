## Discovery

Once a company/project is discovered and we estimate that it could lead to a nice partnership. We need to setup a discovery call with them in order to have a better understanding of their product and help them understand better MESG.

The goal of this meeting is to spot opportunities for collaboration and try to narrow down the details of a future partnership.

## Agreement

Once a discovery call is done, we should have enough material to create a brief of this partnership with the following points:

#### For CompanyX
- How CompanyX will use MESG
- What's the benefits of CompanyX to use MESG
- How MESG can help CompanyX

#### For MESG
- How MESG can use CompanyX
- What's the benefits of MESG to use CompanyX
- How CompanyX can help MESG

If there is a clear answer to these questions and both parts agreed on that we need to have a [Partner Agreement](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FNo_7i12GBhBqJIwNGmIUDFT2OzDFvWC) signed. You can use services like [Hello Sign](https://www.hellosign.com/) to request a signature.

## Material

Once the agreement is signed you need to onboard this new partner.
- Go to [the partner directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1srTbcchL_gPiGknrtWGqNVhptF-mBnu3)
- Add a new directory with the name of the partner with this format `MESG <> CompanyX`
- Copy the partner agreement inside (and all documents that were shared like NDA or similar)
- Share this directory with the partner contact
- You can now both access resources of each others in this directory
- Copy the [Partner Documents](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F3feoNVT5tgSIr-mnVtaby9PJxgUoWOu) in this directory to give details about MESG to this new partner
