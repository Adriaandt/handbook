# Meeting

[[toc]]

**TL;DR:** Try to avoid meetings as much as possible and if you need to, do it efficiently.

Interesting methods of meeting should be explored:

- [Stand up meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting)
- [No computers / No phones](https://timemanagementninja.com/2011/09/5-reasons-to-ban-technology-in-your-meeting/)
- [Notes on paper](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/productivity/meetings/how-to-take-notes-in-meetings)
- [Silence break / Meditation time](https://happymanifesto.com/2014/05/21/start-your-meetings-with-meditation/)

## Planning

If a meeting is necessary, then it needs to be planned. Plan in advance the duration of this meeting and when this meeting should happen.
Think also about who should join this meeting and invite only the relevant people in the meeting.

::: tip
Meetings should not be longer than 1 hour. Ideally 15min should be enough.
:::

Every meeting should have an event on Google Calendar with all the relevant people invited. 

## Availabilities

Make sure that everyone involve in the meeting is available, if not, then the meeting need to be postponed as every participant should be important to the meeting and spectators should not have their time wasted if they are not required.

## Goals

Set specific goals for the meeting, always ask yourself the question:

**What exactly are we meeting about?**

If you **can't** answer it, then there is probably **no need** for a meeting.\
If you **can** answer it, then **put it on the calendar event** to let all the attendees knows why they will meet

## Notes

Two types of notes should be taken:
- **Answers** for the goals set for the meeting
- **Divergent discussions** to keep aside, but not in the scope of the meeting

## Measure success

Important KPIs to look at the end of a meeting:

- **Number of goals achieved** in the meeting (should be 100% :))
- **Duration** of the meeting (should be the one set in the calendar)
