# Communication

[[toc]]

## Internal

### Daily discussions

Daily discussions happen on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/SaZ5HcE).

Make sure to have the role `team` in order to access more discussion channels. [See the list of all roles](/marketing/#chat)

Some discussion might happen on Telegram but this should happen as little as possible or only for 1 to 1 conversation as Telegram is not really user friendly for group conversations.

### Task related discussion

All discussions related to a specific work task should happen on Trello in order to keep this organized. Your task is likely to be in **[this board](https://trello.com/b/Cg1ruDVu/mesg-general-activity-schedule)**

Of course you can always talk with your coworkers on Discord or in live but make sure to log all progress on the Trello card.

## External

Discussions with other persons outside of MESG can be complicated and vary depending of the preferences of this person(s). Try to always prioritize the channel of communication this way:

- **Email**: Easy to track and search. Easy to forward and have people who join (using cc), bad for real time discussions
- **Telegram**: Good for real time discussions but hard to search
- **Skype**: Good for voice conversations but really hard to track

Make sure to use the best tool based on your needs, also when a conversation is interesting make **sure to add the relevant persons** in the discussion.
