## Day off / Remote work

We care about result more than time, if you can do all your job in one week and spend the rest of the month on holiday go for it :smile:.

Holidays are important to release stress and come back with more motivation than ever so, we don't worry much about that.

Also, you might be moving for some personal reasons, but still working or partially working so make sure to log that the same way than your holidays.

::: tip Notification
For day off and part time make sure to notify the team on time.

Consider a week notice for less than a week holiday and two weeks notice for more.
:::

There are still some rules to make sure that everything works perfectly even when you are not here.

Add it to the company level calendar [MESG Availabilities](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mesg.tech_36toa09ndvlltajoke45r0v89s%40group.calendar.google.com) with the following format:

<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?showTitle=0&amp;showNav=0&amp;showDate=0&amp;showPrint=0&amp;showTabs=0&amp;showCalendars=0&amp;showTz=0&amp;mode=AGENDA&amp;height=300&amp;wkst=1&amp;src=mesg.tech_36toa09ndvlltajoke45r0v89s%40group.calendar.google.com" style="border-width:0" height="300" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

```
[TYPE] - NAME (reason)
```

*You don't have to provide any **reason** for time off, this might be personal but if you want it's always nice to know where you are.*

Where `TYPE` that can be 
- **OFF**: holiday
- **PART**: part time
- **REMOTE**: working remotely

eg:
- `[REMOTE] Anthony (Escape pollution)`
- `[OFF] Anthony`
- `[PART] Anthony (Visit family)`

::: warning
Make sure that when off, everything you are working on is accessible and you don't block any other team member.

This is **super important** and if not respected this could impact your next holidays.
