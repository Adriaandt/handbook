### Hackathon

- Audit and edit existing technical onboarding documentation
  - To ensure minimum friction, all [existing onboarding material](/ux/) must be updated to address previous support requests.
- Identify potential strategic partnerships
  - Look for mutually beneficial collaboration opportunities with organizations to run hackathons for greater impact, participation and awareness
- Identify and approach potential partners to contribute to the prize allocation as well as cross-promotion to their audiences.
  - Seek high-profile judges
- Identify hackathon topic/niche
  - The outcome of the hackathon MUST make a material contribution to the five core KPIs
  - Attempt to overlap with the current or forthcoming Key Vertical
  - If a hackathon partner has been secured, this will shape the topic
- Set participation success criteria
  - Research and engage with domain experts in order to determine the judging criteria
- Bring domain specific judges on board
  - Attempt to secure judges with a solid online profile and following - people with credibility whose online following can be leveraged for pre and post hackathon visibility
- Create awareness campaign (focused on attracting participants)
  - Engage with marketing expert on how to create content to engage and entice quality particpants and form a MESG hackahthon community 
- Create public relations campaign (Investor/trader focus)
  - Marketing campaign that focuses on general awareness of the hackathon and creating credibility for the MESG token.
- Set [Hackthon rules](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kDqppueHXrOs7iKej9NSs0iG0sHpWjo2) and ensure compliance
  - Make sure the hackathon follows all legal regulations and define terms for participants. Especially important for online hackathons as many platform like [Devpost](https://devpost.com/) expect to have these legal rules/terms.
- Identify broadcasting platforms
  - Identify all platforms to broadcast marketing material related to creating awareness for both driving participation and general interest for non-participants like investors and marketplace consumers.
- Create community channels specific to the hackathon
  - Primarily on Discord for instant messaging 
  - Ensure that 24/7 technical support is available
- During the hackathon -promote entries on relevant platforms/communities
  - Creating awareness of the entries as the hackathon progresses will stimulate important conversations amongst future participants and token investors.
- Engage with influencers to promote entries.
  - An ongoing campaign to involve niche influencers as we see what entrants are busy building 
  - Create hype over what entrants are building
- Judge winning entries
  - Marketing material/content could be created out of the process
  - This could also be done through a live stream
- Announce winners
  - Explore different publication methods of announcing the winners - eg. a countdown 
- Broadcast announcement of hackathon winners on all relevant channels
  - Broadcast channels established during the early phases of the marketing campaign should be leveraged to ensure maximum exposure of the winners
  - This could also be done through a live stream
- Distribute prizes
  - If the prize is paid in MESG token, we need to ensure participants are aware the price will fluctuate based on the market value 
  - Price is set at the end of the hackathon
  - Price during the distribution (that can happen between x and y days)
- Mine marketing material out of all entries
  - Start before the winners are announced
  - As soon as entries are published, we should seek the input of domain experts and mine compelling content out of the entries
  - What does the entry mean for the tech world? Why is MESG the ideal platform for this, etc.
  - Interview winners: who they are, what are they doing in their life, why they participated, what was their impression of MESG, how they learned of MESG etc.
  - If it is a partner Hackathon, ask partner to promote MESG
- Measure hackathon's impact on key metrics
  - This will likely only be visible some time after the entries are finalized
  - The four key metrics established in the Adoption Strategy should be monitored to see whether the hackathon has made a material contribution to these numbers
- Critical assessment of Hackathon successes and failures
  - What was learned? What did we do right and what did we do wrong?
  - Get input from the entire MESG team as well as participants
  - List changes/improvements for future hackathons
  - Analysis of how the hackathon contributed to MESGâ€™s KPIs
